Ajax and JSON - Book List App
=============================

This application is made with Ajax, JSON, Mustache, JQuery Cycle. This application takes some books data from the JSON file and collects it with AJAX and using Mustache.js and JQuery Cycle it presents the data. I styled it with CSS.

This project is for practice after completing Lynda.com's JavaScript and JSON.
